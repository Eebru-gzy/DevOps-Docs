# **Introduction**

* This project is an introduction to CI - Continous Integration. I implemented CI making use of GitHub Webhook to trigger build on Jenkins server, after which the Jenkins build Artifact then get pushed to the NFS server that is serving the web servers for the DevOps Tooling project that was started from project 7.
